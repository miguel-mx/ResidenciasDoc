Title

Subtitle
--------
Titles are underlined (or over-
and underlined) with a printing nonalphanumeric 7-bit ASCII character. Recommended choices
are "``= - ` : ' " ~ ^ _ * + # < >``".
The underline/overline must be at least as long as the title text.

A lone top-level (sub)section is lifted up to be the document's (sub)title.

**This is a paragraph.**

Paragraphs line up at their left
edges, and are normally separated
by blank lines.

A paragraph containing only two colons
indicates that the following indented
or quoted text is a literal block.

::

  Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and
  all kinds of markup (like *this* or
  \this) is preserved by literal blocks.

  The paragraph containing only '::'
  will be omitted from the result.

Simple table:
